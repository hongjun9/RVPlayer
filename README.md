# RVPlayer: Robotic Vehicle Forensics by Replaywith What-if Reasoning

## Introduction

**RVPlayer** is a robotic vehicle (RV) forensic tool that supports replay with what-if reasoning inside simulator to replace expensive field test based forensics. It features an efficient demand-driven adaptive logging method, a novel replay tehcnique supporting various replay policies that selectively enable/disable information during replay. 

This provides a prototype of our tool and data set to play, including system identification functions, a adaptive logging module, a replayer in a simulator, flight data for real and simulated vehicles.
